# Machine Learning Classifiers Examples

This project demonstrates various machine learning classification algorithms and techniques using a social media advertising dataset. It's designed for educational purposes to compare different classification approaches and optimization methods.

## Project Overview

This educational project explores multiple classification algorithms, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation techniques. It provides practical examples of how different classifiers perform on the same dataset and demonstrates various ML concepts.

## Dataset

The Social Media Ads dataset contains:
- **User ID**: Unique identifier for each user
- **Gender**: Male/Female
- **Age**: Age of the user
- **EstimatedSalary**: Estimated annual salary
- **Purchased**: Target variable (0 = No purchase, 1 = Purchase)

The goal is to predict whether a user will purchase a product based on their demographic information.

## Classification Algorithms

The project implements and compares:

### Basic Classifiers
- **Decision Tree Classifier**: Tree-based decision making
- **Logistic Regression**: Linear probabilistic classifier
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Margin-based classifier with RBF kernel

### Optimization Techniques
- **Grid Search CV**: Hyperparameter optimization for SVM
- **K-Fold Cross Validation**: Model validation technique
- **Standard Scaling**: Feature normalization
