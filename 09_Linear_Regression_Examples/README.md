# Linear Regression Examples

This project provides educational examples of linear regression implementation using both custom implementation and scikit-learn library. It demonstrates fundamental regression concepts and practical applications.

## Project Overview

This educational project covers linear regression from basic concepts to practical implementation, showing both mathematical foundations and real-world applications using housing price prediction.

## Datasets

The project uses housing price datasets:
- **Egypt House Prices**: Egyptian real estate market data
- **General Housing Data**: Additional housing dataset for comparison

Features typically include:
- Property size/area
- Number of rooms/bedrooms
- Location factors
- Property age
- Market conditions
- **Target**: Property price

## Implementation Approaches

### 1. Custom Linear Regression (`linear_regression.py`)
- Mathematical implementation from scratch
- Understanding the underlying algorithms
- Manual calculation of coefficients
- Basic gradient descent implementation

### 2. Scikit-learn Implementation (`linear_regression_sk.py`)
- Professional library usage
- Optimized algorithms
- Built-in evaluation metrics
- Easy model deployment

## Files Structure

- `linear_regression.py`: Custom implementation of linear regression
- `linear_regression_sk.py`: Scikit-learn based implementation
- `data/`: Housing datasets
  - `egypt_House_prices.csv`: Egyptian housing market data
  - Additional housing data files
