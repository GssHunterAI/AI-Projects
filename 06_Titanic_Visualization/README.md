# Titanic Data Visualization

This project provides comprehensive data visualization and analysis of the famous Titanic passenger dataset, exploring survival patterns and passenger demographics.

## Project Overview

This analysis focuses on creating insightful visualizations to understand the factors that influenced passenger survival on the Titanic. The project emphasizes exploratory data analysis through various plotting techniques and statistical visualizations.

## Dataset

The Titanic dataset contains information about passengers aboard the RMS Titanic:

- **PassengerId**: Unique identifier for each passenger
- **Survived**: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- **Pclass**: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
- **Name**: Passenger name
- **Sex**: Gender
- **Age**: Age in years
- **SibSp**: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
- **Parch**: Number of parents/children aboard
- **Ticket**: Ticket number
- **Fare**: Passenger fare
- **Cabin**: Cabin number
- **Embarked**: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

## Files Structure

- `Visualization_Titanic.ipynb`: Complete visualization analysis notebook

## Visualization Features

The notebook includes various types of visualizations:

### Survival Analysis
- Survival rates by passenger class
- Gender-based survival patterns
- Age distribution and survival correlation
- Family size impact on survival

### Demographic Analysis
- Passenger class distribution
- Age and gender demographics
- Fare distribution across classes
- Embarkation port analysis

### Advanced Visualizations
- Correlation heatmaps
- Multi-dimensional scatter plots
- Survival probability by multiple factors
- Interactive plots (if applicable)

## Key Insights

The visualizations reveal:
- Higher survival rates for women and children
- Impact of passenger class on survival chances
- Fare and survival relationship
- Family size effects on survival probability
- Port of embarkation patterns
